# Plan files

I use Microsoft One Note to track my daily plan backlog, journals and other things being worked on.  I've blogged using Hugo, Wordpress, Blogger, and other static web site and CMS tools.  I always found the purity and simplicity of plan files and the `notes to self` approach for internal blogging interesting.

This is a Copilot Agents experiment to generate `old-school` Finger'able plan files from content and git log history.
